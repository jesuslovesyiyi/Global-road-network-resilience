**Research gaps that we found:**

Anthropogenic climate change and rapid urbanization, combined with increasing interdependencies among various critical infrastructure systems, are forcing road transportation networks under climatic pressure more than ever in human history. With the European floods as the backdrop, we have witnessed the growing fragility and interconnectivity of road infrastructure networks in the face of catastrophic events. Although three decades of studies attempted to understand the infrastructure vulnerability and flood risks, we discovered two gaps that prohibit us from building a solid understanding of the real impact of flood hazards and generating climate solutions that are genuinely effective after a thorough literature review.

1.	Current policies and regulations for infrastructure networks are skewed heavily towards pure <u>hazard exposure</u> since the complexity of global human mobility, particularly through road transportation, makes it increasingly challenging to develop effective management and mitigation strategies. To this day, a global evaluation of the indirect impact that considers <u>the movement of people</u> on these networks is still absent.
2.	Although many countries and regions have set forth climate action plans and disaster risk reduction protocols, the <u>governing factors</u> determining road networks' resilience to flood hazards remain a mystery. Consequently, investments made without a fundamental understanding of the drivers behind road network resilience will render futile.

**Our contribution:**

In this study, we provide the first global evaluation of direct and, more importantly, indirect flood impact on road networks for <span style="color:navy">**2,564**</span> human settlements representing over <span style="color:navy">**14 million kilometers**</span> of road networks spanning <span style="color:navy">**177 countries**</span> and regions under ten flood intensities. The main contributions of our study are threefold:

1.	We look <u>beyond infrastructure exposure</u> and simulate the impact of floods on <u>mobility</u> concerning road transportation networks <u>worldwide</u>, comparing and contrasting network resilience between countries and regions worldwide.

2.	We identified <u>ten global hot spots</u> with statistically significant clusters of networks of high indirect impact levels. These areas merit considerable attention since the interconnectivity between networks could ignite a domino-like effect causing individual failures in one network to propagate to other networks in close spatial proximity.

3.	We pinpoint three underlying drivers: <u>exposure</u>, <u>connectivity</u>, and <u>travel pattern</u> that influence the resilience of road networks based on global data. The result facilitates the development of <u>region-specific</u> hazard mitigation objectives and investigation plans, effectively reducing the indirect repercussions of floods.

In sum, the study has its genesis rooted in publications in this journal, warranting a broad impact among audiences in the academic fields, policy-makers, governments, and beyond. The paper will fundamentally enrich the tools scientists and engineers use to approach infrastructure resilience to natural disasters.
