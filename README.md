# Global-road-network-resilience
This study provides the first global evaluation of both direct and indirect flood hazard impacts on urban road transportation networks. We construct topological road networks for 2,564 human settlements, representing over 14 million kilometers of urban roads. We assess their exposure to pluvial and fluvial flood risks under ten scenarios, corresponding to different flood intensities (1:5 to 1:1000 year return periods). Under each scenario, we analyze direct infrastructure exposure and assess the indirect effects of flood-induced mobility disruptions: route failures, travel delays, and travel distance increases. Our results document a positive relationship between flood return period and flood impact (both direct and indirect). Compared with direct flood hazard exposure, the indirect impact of floods on mobility is more prominent and heterogeneous. The average share of the road network that is flooded by at least 0.3 meters is 3.64% (or 24.84%) under the 5-year (or 1000-year) return periodâ€“yet 11.58% (or 65.67%) of simulated trips fail in the same scenario. The results enable comparisons of exposure and vulnerability of road networks to flood hazards across countries, allowing the identification and prioritization of urban transport resilience measures. Our study builds a comparative understanding of the vulnerability of road networks to flood hazards under ten distinct return periods by identifying the spatial heterogeneity in mobility loss due to travel speed reduction and road closure. We call attention to particular world regions where targeted initiatives for flood mitigation and adaptation measures in the transportation sector are most critical while also recognizing areas where large-scale interconnected road network failures might occur. We explore explanatory variables that can capture the variation observed in the indirect impact of floods on mobility and point to three governing features: exposure, network connectivity, and travel pattern. We evaluate their relative importance in different geographic regions and make policy-relevant recommendations for increasing network resilience. This effort facilitates the development of region-specific hazard mitigation objectives and investment plans, effectively reducing the indirect repercussions of floods.
